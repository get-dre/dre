# Build and run reports

```bash
dre init                 # pick a source, enter its connection, optionally start a project
cd my_reports
dre validate             # check the project and compile its SQL
dre validate -s monthly  # ...and show where monthly's output would go
dre compile -s daily,monthly       # render the SQL into target/compiled/ and list the files
dre run                  # run every report; output lands in target/run/
dre run monthly --preview 50       # sample 50 rows, never delivered
dre run -s tag:regulatory --set all  # every regulatory report, for every Set
dre validate --live      # check every statement against the database without running it
dre ls --schedule close_monthly    # list the Bindings a schedule runs (--output json for tools)
dre clean                # remove the target folder
dre system update        # update DRE itself
```

A report is a YAML file next to its `.sql` files:

```yaml
# reports/finance/monthly/monthly.yml
queries:
  - {query: setup_temp_accounts, tab: false}   # CREATE TEMP TABLE: runs first, no tab
  - {query: summary, tab_name: Summary}
  - detail
output:
  format: xlsx
  destination:
    profile: reports_s3
    path: "s3://reports/{{ var('client') }}/monthly-{{ run.date.yyyymmdd }}.xlsx"
sets: [client_a, client_b]
default_set: client_a
```

Queries run one after another in the order listed, each on its connection's session (one per
connection the report uses), so a temp table made by one is there for the next query on the same
connection. A query can run on its own connection with `profile:`, or by reading a
[source](sources.md) that names one; see [Connections and targets](connections.md). Each `.sql` file makes one tab (a sheet in xlsx, or one file
for csv, parquet and the other single-table formats), named by `tab_name` or else the file's
name, in the same order. The YAML decides the tabs, not the data:

- A file can hold several statements; the last one is the tab and the earlier ones prepare data.
  A second `SELECT` in a tab file is an error: give each tab its own `.sql` file.
- `tab: false` runs a file only for what it does (temp tables, `SET`s) and discards any result.
- A tab whose query returns no rows still appears, with its column names.
- A tab file whose last statement returns no result set at all is an error that points at
  `tab: false`.

The output file is named after the report (`monthly.xlsx`), or after the first destination's
`path`. `extension:` changes the extension for text formats that feed other systems, e.g. a bank
file that must end in `.aba`, or drops it with `extension: ""`:

```yaml
output:
  format: fixed_width
  extension: aba          # payments.aba instead of payments.txt; "" for no extension
  columns: [...]
```

`output:` can also be a list: the queries run once and each output is made from the same results,
from the queries its `queries:` names (all of them by default). A named output writes
`<name>.<ext>`, and a Set changes one output by giving its `name:`, or replaces the whole list.
File outputs are delivered first, then messages:

```yaml
output:
  - name: workbook
    format: xlsx
    queries: [summary, detail]
    destination: {profile: reports_s3, path: "s3://reports/monthly.xlsx"}
  - name: headline
    format: message          # a short headline built from the results; see Messages
    queries: [summary]
    destination: {profile: team_slack, channel: "#finance"}
```

`--output-name` and `--output-path` apply to the first output. See [messages](messages.md) for
message outputs, `when:` and `attach:`.

> **Changed in 0.2.** Connections are under `connections:` (was `sources:`). In 0.2.1 each
> profile has its own default `target:` again, and a missing entry is an error. See
> [Upgrading to 0.2](migrating-to-0.2.md).

Connections live in `profiles.yml`. DRE looks for it, in order, in `--profiles-dir`,
`DRE_PROFILES_DIR`, the project directory (next to `dre_project.yml`), and `~/.dre`, the same order
as dbt; `dre validate` and `dre run -v` say which file they used. Database connections go under
`connections:` and delivery targets under `destinations:`, each with one entry per target
(environment):

```yaml
connections:
  warehouse:
    targets:
      dev: {type: duckdb, path: dev.duckdb}
      prod: {type: postgres, host: db.internal, user: reports, password: "{{ env_var('PG_PASSWORD') }}"}
destinations:
  reports_s3:
    targets:
      dev: {deliver: false}
      prod: {type: s3, bucket: reports}
```

Each profile the run uses picks its entry: `--target`, else `DRE_TARGET` (either sets every
profile), else the profile's own `target:`, else `dev`. A used profile without that entry is an
error before anything runs; `dev: {deliver: false}` says `reports_s3` delivers nowhere on a dev
run, and the output stays in the target folder. See [Connections and targets](connections.md).

`dre init` writes this file for you, in `~/.dre` (never into a project). A `profiles.yml` kept
in the project, e.g. for CI, a container or a Databricks job, should take every secret from
`env_var()` so nothing secret is committed.

Targets can share settings with YAML anchors and merge keys, in `profiles.yml` and every other
YAML file DRE reads; keys written out win over merged ones:

```yaml
connections:
  warehouse:
    targets:
      dev: &pg {type: postgres, host: db.internal, user: reports, database: shop}
      prod:
        <<: *pg
        database: shop_prod
```

Plugin packages and macro packages are declared in `dependencies.yml` (or `packages.yml`, or
both):

```yaml
plugins:
  - duckdb
  - xlsx
  - object_store      # the s3, gcs and azure_blob destinations
packages:
  - git: https://github.com/acme/finance_macros.git
    revision: v2.3.0
```

`dre run`, `dre validate` and `dre compile` install what's missing into the project's
`dre_deps/` folder before they start, so there's nothing to run first. `dre deps` installs
everything and refreshes the lock on purpose, e.g. as a separate CI step. Exact versions and
commits are pinned in `dre.lock`. Package macros are called through the package's name
(`{{ dre_utils.star(ref('customers'), except=['ssn']) }}`), and `dispatch()` lets a package offer per-database variants
that a project can override. See [the registry docs](registry.md).
