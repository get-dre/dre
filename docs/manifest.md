# The manifest and `run_results.json`

DRE writes two kinds of JSON file into the [target path](target-path.md)
(`target/` unless you move it). They read as a pair:

- **`manifest.json`** says what the project *is*: every report, Set, Binding, schedule and
  plugin, as DRE resolves them. One file for the whole project.
- **`run/<report>/<binding>/runs/<run id>/run_results.json`** says what one run of one Binding *did*: its
  vars, rows, files, deliveries and status. It records the checksum of the manifest the run
  wrote, so a run's results can be matched to the exact project behind them.

> **Changed in 0.2.** Schema 2: a `sources` section, the run's `target`, and each query's
> `connection` and `depends_on`. Like dbt's, the manifest is resolved for the run's inputs. See
> [Upgrading to 0.2](migrating-to-0.2.md).

The manifest (and `dre ls --output json`, which prints part of it) is DRE's supported way for
orchestrators, CI and other tools to read a project. Read it rather than DRE's YAML: it has the
layering (project < folders < report < Set) and schedule resolution already applied.

## The project manifest at a glance

`dre compile`, `dre validate` and `dre run` write `target/manifest.json`: the whole project as
DRE resolves it, whatever was selected. It lists every report with its Sets and Bindings (merged
vars, queries with their connection and the sources they read, output, destinations), every
schedule with the Bindings it runs, the declared [sources](sources.md) and plugins, and checksums
for change detection. It's built offline, with no connection or `profiles.yml`, never contains
secrets or connection settings, and is the same byte for byte for the same project and the same
inputs (below). An orchestrator can generate one task per schedule from it (each runs
`dre run --schedule <name>`), and CI can compare two manifests to find the reports a change
touched. `dre ls` prints slices of it: `dre ls -s tag:regulatory`, `dre ls --schedule
close_monthly --output json`. See its [JSON Schema](manifest.schema.json).

## When it's written

`dre compile`, `dre validate` and `dre run` write `manifest.json` right after the project loads
and the [parse pass](connections.md#the-parse-pass) has rendered each query without a database,
before any SQL runs, in every mode (selectors, `--set`, `--schedule`, `--dry-run`,
`--preview`). It always describes the whole project, whatever was selected. A run that fails
later still leaves the manifest it started from.

- A report with problems (a missing query file, a bad option, a query whose parse pass fails or
  whose connection doesn't resolve) is listed with `"valid": false` and its `errors`; the manifest is still written. `dre validate` still fails. `valid` covers
  the checks made when the project loads; the ones that need plugins or rendering (option checks,
  compiling) come after the manifest is written and are reported by `dre validate` itself.
- A project that can't load at all (no `dre_project.yml`, unreadable YAML) writes no manifest and
  removes an old one, so a stale file is never taken as current.
- The file is written to a temporary name and renamed, so a reader never sees half of it.
- `dre ls` never writes it; `dre clean` removes it with the rest of the target folder.

It's built offline: no database connection, no `profiles.yml` and no plugins are needed, so it
works on a fresh CI runner with no credentials.

### Resolved for the run's inputs

Like dbt's, the manifest records values resolved from the run's inputs: the run's target
(`--target`, `DRE_TARGET`, else `dev`), `--var` and the project's vars, environment variables,
and `run.*` (`DRE_RUN_DATE`, `DRE_RUN_AT`, `--timezone`). Jinja in `profile:` values and in source fields
decides each query's connection, a destination's profile and a source's `schema`, so two targets
can give two manifests. The same project with the same inputs gives the same bytes. CI that
compares manifests should build both with the same target and vars.

```

- **`schema_version`**: the format's version (see [Versioning](#versioning)). **`version`**: the DRE
  that wrote it.
- **`project`**: its name, the run's target (`target.name`, never a profile's own default), the
  default connection (as written), `timezone:`, and the project-wide [checksum](#checksums).
- **`reports`**, by name: whether it's managed (declared in YAML) or a bare `.sql`, its defining
  file, folder segments, tags, timezone, default Set, queries (with tab settings and column
  options, and a query's own `profile:` as written), every source any Binding reads
  (`depends_on.sources`), [checksum](#checksums), validity, and its Bindings.
- **Each Binding**: its Set (`null` for a report without Sets), the inherited connection
  (rendered), fully merged vars, queries (each with the `connection` it runs on and
  `depends_on.sources`, from the parse pass), `outputs` in declared order (name, format, the
  queries it formats, `when`, options, extension, template file, and its destinations: rendered
  profile name and the path template, unrendered), and the schedules that run it. `output` repeats
  the first output and `destinations` lists every output's destinations, as before 0.3.
- **`schedules`**, by name: the report or selector and Set it targets, its timing (`cron`,
  `every` or `rrule` with `starting`, `at`, `except` and `also`; a shared timing's fields, with its
  name in `timing`), whether it's `enabled`, its vars and timezone, and the Bindings it runs,
  resolved the way `dre run --schedule <name>` resolves them. To know when each one fires, with the
  exact command for each firing, use [`dre schedule ls`](schedule-ls.md).
- **`sources`**, by name: each declared source with its rendered `profile`, `database` and
  `schema`, description, tags and meta, and its tables (rendered `identifier`, the `quoting`
  that applies, declared columns, and `used_by`, the reports that read it; empty when unused).
  `source()` names a table as `source.table` everywhere in the manifest.
- **`plugins`**: the declared packages, each with its version requirement and source
  (`registry`, `github` or `local`, plus a `location` unless it's DRE's own registry).

Paths are relative to the project root with forward slashes on every OS. Keys are sorted. There
are no timestamps, host names or absolute paths, so the same project gives the same bytes on any
machine, and moving the target path doesn't change the file.

### What's left out

- Anything that only exists after rendering: compiled SQL (that's `compiled/`), rendered output
  and destination paths, `connection.*` values.
- Connection settings and credentials. Profiles appear by name only.
- Secrets: values of `DRE_SECRET_*` variables are masked as `*****`, as in `run_results.json`
  and the compiled SQL (`mask_secrets: false` in `dre_project.yml` turns that off everywhere).
- Engine internals that might change meaning. A field is left out rather than shipped with a
  meaning that could shift.

### Checksums

Every checksum is a SHA-256 in hex, over file contents only (not timestamps), in a fixed order.

- A **report's** `checksum` covers its defining file (YAML, or the `.sql` of an unmanaged report),
  each of its query files, and its template file.
- The **project's** `checksum` covers the shared inputs: `dre_project.yml`, folder config,
  `schedules.yml`, `dependencies.yml` and any other YAML that isn't a report's own, everything
  under `macros/` and `lookups/`, and every `.sql` under `reports/` that isn't a declared query
  (the usual `ref()` targets, including unmanaged reports).

To find what a change touched, compare two manifests: if the project checksum differs, treat
every report as changed; otherwise the reports whose checksum differs are the ones to preview or
validate (`dre validate -s a,b`).

## `dre ls`

`dre ls` prints the reports and Bindings a selection covers, with the same selectors as `run`:

```bash
dre ls                              # every Binding
dre ls -s tag:regulatory --set all  # a selection
dre ls --schedule close_monthly     # exactly what that schedule runs
dre ls --schedule close_monthly --output json
```

The default output is one Binding per line (report, Set, the connections its queries run on,
format, destinations). `dre ls -s source:sales.orders` lists the reports that read a source
table, and `dre ls --resource-type source` lists the declared sources, flagging unused ones (see
[Sources](sources.md#listing-sources)). `--target` and `--var` resolve them as a run would.
`--output json` prints a document in the manifest's shape holding only the matching reports and
Bindings (and, with `--schedule`, that schedule). Data goes to stdout and messages to stderr; a
selector or schedule that matches nothing exits 2 (see [exit codes](exit-codes.md)). `dre ls` needs no connection or
`profiles.yml` and writes nothing.

`dre validate --json` includes the same document under `"project"`.

## `run_results.json`

Each Binding a `dre run` executes writes `run/<report>/<set or default>/runs/<run id>/run_results.json`
in the target path (`dre history <report> --latest --path` prints the latest run's folder; see
[the target path](target-path.md)). It records its `run_id`, the report, Set, the inherited `profile`, the `target`, the
`connections` its queries used, the schedule and its vars, every
var the run used, the run date and timezone, the command's parameters, the status (`success`,
`error`, `cancelled` when Ctrl-C or a termination signal stopped it, `timed_out` when its timeout
expired) and any error,
each result set (rows, columns and the `connection` it came from), each output file (`path`, relative to the project root, or to
the target path when that's outside the project), each delivery (its profile, `type`, `target`
and `status`: `delivered`, `not_delivered` for a `{deliver: false}` entry, or `failed`), schema
drift, the resolved
`target_path`, and `manifest_checksum`: the SHA-256 of the `manifest.json` bytes that run wrote.

With several outputs, `outputs` (every file) and `deliveries` (every destination) cover all of
them, and each file names its `output`. `output_results` has one entry per output, in declared
order: its `name`, `format`, the `queries` it formatted, its `status` (`delivered`, `kept` when
it stays in the target path, `skipped` when its `when:` was false or its message rendered empty,
or `failed`), any `error`, its `files`, `delivery` note and `deliveries`; `when` (true or false)
when it has a `when:`; and for a message output, `message` with the full rendered `title` and
`text` that were sent. A report's checksum covers a message output's `file:` template, like an
xlsx template.

## Versioning

Both files are public contracts with a `schema_version`, and JSON Schemas generated from DRE's
own types: [manifest.schema.json](manifest.schema.json) for the manifest (`dre/manifest/v3`) and
[run-results.schema.json](run-results.schema.json) for `run_results.json`
(`dre/run-results/v1`).

- Adding an optional field keeps the version. Ignore fields you don't know.
- Removing, renaming or re-typing a field, or changing what a field means, bumps it: in a minor
  DRE release before 1.0, a major one after. Check `schema_version` and refuse one you don't
  support.

> **Changed in 0.4.** The manifest's `"schema": 2` is replaced by
> `"schema_version": "dre/manifest/v3"`, with nothing else changed. `run_results.json` gains
> `schema_version` (`dre/run-results/v1`), and a failed run's `error_code` and `error_kind` (see
> the [error codes reference](reference-error-codes.md)).

Before 0.4 the manifest had `"schema": 2` (DRE 0.2 and 0.3) or `"schema": 1` (DRE 0.1, without
sources, target or per-query connection).

The idea of a project manifest comes from dbt; the format and code are DRE's own.

## Inspect a concrete run

```bash
dre validate --project-dir examples/tutorial --json
dre run --project-dir examples/tutorial --preview 5
dre history --project-dir examples/tutorial --latest --path tutorial
```

Replace `tutorial` with the report name shown by `dre ls --project-dir examples/tutorial`.
The complete [tutorial example](../examples/tutorial/) gives a small manifest and run-result
pair to inspect. Use the history path rather than assuming a fixed run directory.
`project-file-missing` leaves no current manifest; do not reuse a manifest saved from another
directory or target. A consumer must inspect `valid`, status and delivery fields: a JSON file's
existence does not mean the report passed. See [CLI reference](cli-reference.md),
[manifest](glossary.md#manifest) and [run results](glossary.md#run_resultsjson).
