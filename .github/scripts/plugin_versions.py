"""Warn about plugin packages (and dre-protocol) whose code changed but whose version didn't.

    plugin_versions.py <base ref>

Each plugin package has its own version (plugins/<package>/Cargo.toml, go/<package>/VERSION)
and is released by tagging `<package>-v<version>`. A Go package's code includes the shared protocol
module in go/plugin. A change to a package's code since <base ref>
without a version bump is reported as a GitHub Actions warning, so a fix doesn't sit unreleased
by accident. The same goes for the dre-protocol crate, which has its own version and is published
to crates.io only when that version is new. Tests and Markdown don't count. It never fails:
releasing stays a deliberate tag.
