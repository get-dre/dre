# DRE

**DRE** stands for **Declarative Reporting Engine**.

DRE is SQL (plus a template) in, a correctly formatted file out. You declare reports as YAML and
`.sql` files in a dbt-shaped project. DRE runs the SQL against your databases (each tab of a
workbook can come from a different one, and tables can be declared as dbt-style sources), writes the result as
csv, delimited, fixed-width, parquet or xlsx (including multi-sheet workbooks, number formats,
formulas and totals rows, and branded Excel templates), and delivers the file wherever it needs
to go. It runs on whatever scheduler you already have: cron, Airflow, Dagster, Databricks Jobs.

Status: under active development, before 1.0. A patch release never breaks a project; a minor
release may, with release notes and a [migration guide](docs/migrating-to-0.2.md).

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://getdre.com/install.sh | sh   # macOS and Linux
brew install get-dre/tap/dre                                                          # Homebrew
pip install dre-cli                                                                   # pip, uv, pipx
```

More ways, and Windows, in [Install](docs/install.md). Or let a coding agent do it: DRE's
[agent skills](skills/README.md) guide you from installing DRE to a delivered report.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add get-dre/dre && claude plugin install dre@dre   # Claude Code
npx skills add get-dre/dre#skills-latest                                     # other agents
```

Then ask: "help me with dre".

## Quick start

```bash
dre init               # pick a source, enter its connection, start a project
cd my_reports
dre validate           # check the project and compile its SQL
dre run                # run every report; output lands in target/run/
```
